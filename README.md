# python-scheduling-assistant

The plan for this project is to create a scheduling assistant that takes reads in multiple peoples calanders/daily schedules and finds gaps for meetings.

This is to keep me programming since my focus is elsewhere and will be until september.

## Version 1

The plan for the first iteration is purely to make sure the logic is solid. I will pass in some basic input most likely in the form of a list.

I will then concantenate the lists and remove duplicates to elimate times when meetings cant be scheduled.

This is as **basic** as I want to keep **version 1** as I dont want things to start spiraling early doors.
